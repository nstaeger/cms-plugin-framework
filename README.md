# CMS Plugin Framework

A PHP framework for rapid CMS plugin development. (Currently only supports WordPress)

As there is currently no documentation available, you can checkout the [WP Post Email Notification plugin](https://github.com/nstaeger/wp-post-email-notification), which uses this framework.
